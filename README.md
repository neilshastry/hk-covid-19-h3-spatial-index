# HK Covid-19 dynamic visualization of cases using Uber H3 Spatial Index

## Background
Personal project to build a spatial index visualization to quickly identify Covid-19 hotspots in Hong Kong based on HK Gov health data and plan my daily outdoor movements to avoid districts and buildings with high covid cases.

## Objectives
Visualize neighbourhoods (districts and buildings) with an overlayed h3 polygon heatmap of covid-19 cases based on intensity

# HK Covid-19 dynamic visualization of cases using Uber H3 Spatial Index

## Background
Personal project to build a spatial index visualization to quickly identify Covid-19 hotspots in Hong Kong based on HK Gov health data and plan my daily outdoor movements to avoid districts and buildings with high covid cases in the last 14 days.

## Objectives
Visualize neighbourhoods (districts and buildings) with an overlayed h3 polygon heatmap on districts and buildings with covid-19 cases based on intensity

## What is H3

[![Open Source Love svg1](https://badges.frapsoft.com/os/v1/open-source.svg?v=103)](https://eng.uber.com/category/articles/open-source-articles/)

Uber H3 is a grid system for efficiently optimizing ride pricing and dispatch, for visualizing and exploring spatial data. H3 enables Uber to analyze geographic information to set dynamic prices and make other decisions on a city-wide level. They use H3 as the grid system for analysis and optimization throughout marketplaces. It provides functions for converting latitude/longitude coordinates into H3 geospatial hexagonal tiles. 

It is written in C but there are bindings available for other languages.
